# Parsing

## Tools

- [lalrpop](https://github.com/lalrpop/lalrpop) LR(1) parser generator
    + error recovery
    + close(ish)ly related to parsing layed out by aho
    + good documentation
    + a few languages already implemented using it

- [pest](https://pest.rs/) PEG parser generator
    + fantastic tooling
    + (supposed) very fast
    + grammars are prettier (to me at least)
